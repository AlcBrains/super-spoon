# Shooting Sessions Recorder

Yeah. So this is an angular/electron application that allows you to record a shooting session in terms of ammunition type, quantity, etc.
Basically, you fire up the app, record all your shooting sessions, and you can see profit data, and filter them based on ammo type, name of shooter, match type (training, simple match, championship), and switch between viewing only last month's or last semester's records.

I know you're wondering why I did this, since Excel can offer the same functionality, and probably does it better.
My dad made me, I ran out of excuses.
